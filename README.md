## Models and STL generation from .scad files

`_data/assets.yml` describes the files that make up your project.
It should be a series of blocks.
At a minimum the block must have a name and an stl file.
It can optionally have notes, an scad file, scad generation flags, images, and other downloads.
You can refer to a source scad file multiple times with different flags,
in order to generate related or parametric models.
